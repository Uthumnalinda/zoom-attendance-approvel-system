# 👥 Student Approval System

## Overview

The application now includes a **student verification and approval system** that automatically approves or rejects Zoom meeting participants based on whether they exist in the student database.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Student Registration
Before a student can be approved for meetings, they must be registered in the database:
- Admin adds students via the **Student Manager**
- Required fields: Username, Full Name, Email (optional)
- Each student gets a unique ID in the database

### 2. Automatic Verification During Attendance Fetch

When you fetch attendance from a Zoom meeting:

**Step 1:** Admin enters the Zoom Meeting UUID  
**Step 2:** System fetches all participants from Zoom  
**Step 3:** System checks each participant against the student database  
**Step 4:** System categorizes participants:

✅ **APPROVED** - Name matches a student in database  
❌ **REJECTED** - Name not found in database  

### 3. Matching Algorithm

The system matches participants using **flexible name matching**:

```javascript
Participant matches Student if:
- Zoom name contains student username
- Student username contains Zoom name
- Zoom name contains student full name
- Student full name contains Zoom name

// Case-insensitive comparison
```

**Examples:**

| Zoom Display Name | Student in DB | Match? |
|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| john.doe | john.doe | ✅ Yes |
| John Doe | john.doe | ✅ Yes |
| john.doe (iPhone) | john.doe | ✅ Yes |
| Jane Smith | Jane Smith | ✅ Yes |
| unknown.user | (not in DB) | ❌ No |

**Solutions:**
1. Add student to database
2. Ask student to update Zoom display name
3. Update student record with correct name

### Issue: Wrong student matched

**Cause:** Similar names causing incorrect match

**Solution:**
- Use more specific usernames
- Update matching logic if needed
- Manually correct attendance record

### Issue: All participants rejected

**Causes:**
1. Student database is empty
2. Backend API error
3. Zoom API credentials issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check that students are registered
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify Zoom API credentials in `.env`
