/* This is a placeholder for the application icon */
/* 
To add a proper icon:
1. Create a 512x512 PNG image for your app icon
2. Save it as icon.png in the public folder
3. You can use online tools like:
   - https://www.canva.com
   - https://www.figma.com
   - Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator

Icon design suggestions:
- Use education/attendance related symbols (graduation cap, checklist, calendar)
- Use your institution's colors
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast

For now, the build process will use the default Electron icon if this file doesn't exist.
